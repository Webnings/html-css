            <p>Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.[1] In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.</p><p>The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.</p>

            <h2>A right-handed three-dimensional</h2>
            <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is conceived as curved, rather than flat, as in the Euclidean space. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space.</p> <p>Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.</p>
            <h2>Mathematics</h2>
            <p>In modern mathematics spaces are defined as sets with some added structure.             They are frequently described as different types of manifolds, which are            spaces that locally approximate to Euclidean space, and where the properties        are defined largely on local connectedness of points that lie on the        manifold</p>. <p>There are however, many diverse mathematical objects that are        called spaces. For example, vector spaces such as function spaces may have      infinite numbers of independent dimensions and a notion of distance very      different from Euclidean space, and topological spaces replace the concept       of distance with a more abstract idea of nearness.</p>
